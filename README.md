# Rust OCI Wasm implementation

This repo contains a Rust crate implementing the [OCI Wasm
Specification](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/wasm/deliverables/wasm-oci-artifact/). It is a thin
wrapper around the [oci-distribution](https://crates.io/crates/oci-distribution) crate with the
specific config types needed for the OCI Wasm specification.
